"A micro-manipulation method based on adhesion forces and dynamic effects has been proposed in our previous papers. A prototype manipulator, called [mu]MAD, has been constructed and successfully experimented. This paper describes the advanced capabilities of [mu]MAD, especially two new interesting applications: sorting of micro-objects and mechanical characterizations."
"When chaos calls / Bedlam abounds. Is now a good time to unplug and move to the woods?

Here is the good news: We are completely doomed.

Isn't that great? Isn't that reassuring? It damn well should be, because, in some form or another and since we were knee-high to a cave painting, the apocalypse has always, always been nigh.

It is perhaps the single most wonderful and reliable aspect about being a tiny troubled biped on this tiny troubled speck of spinning space dust; depending on whom you listen to, depending on how dialed in you are to the various nefarious signs and conspiracy theories and reruns of ""The Omen"" on late-night cable, we are always on the verge of imminent and unstoppable doom. It's just a matter of which supremely peeved deity -- God? Nukes? Bees? Trees? Peanut butter? -- you believe is about to bring the hammer down.

If nothing else, this unfailing belief in our imminent demise makes us terribly consistent. And consistency, aside from being a nasty hobgoblin, also provides terrific comfort. And comfort, in times of chaos and imminent apocalypse, is always sort of nice. See how that works?

In the Bush Dark Times, the apocalypse took the form of various charming little munchkins, like the gay agenda, Buddha tattoos, nu-metal, female nipples, Bill O'Reilly's adorable ""culture wars,"" gangsta rap, condoms, bad art, Muslim fanatics who want to confiscate your porn collection, stem cell research, Hillary Clinton and teenagers having lots of anal sex and calling it chastity. So cute!

But now, in the Obama Enlightenment, a very strange thing has occurred. It's as though Armageddon finally got a glimpse of itself in the mirror, saw what the GOP and Christian right had done to it and went, ""Holy hell, who put these f--king clown shoes on me and cut my hair in a mullet and stamped this idiotic 'Left Behind' logo on my forehead?""

And then it went on a rampage.

Result: The apocalypse is no longer the illegible stick-figure cartoon Dubya liked to scribble on the bathtub wall while high on whippets and too many Ding-Dongs. Armageddon has taken on new shape and identity, ripped off its Disney costume to reveal a much darker and more sinister persona: global economic collapse, violent climate change, oceans in crisis, food shortages and water shortages and ice caps melting so quickly scientists are hauling life rafts to the research centers. Doom is now stripped down, battle scarred, global and mean.

Accordingly, many people are looking around in increasing panic, wondering, ""Now? Is it now? Should I just chuck it all and unplug the iMac and quit updating my damnable Facebook status and move off the grid, somewhere with plenty of fresh water and lots of paranoia and free guns and no one will dare mess with my potato crops, what with all the barbed wire and trained attack dogs -- like, say northern Idaho or Canada or Afghanistan?""

Verily, every urban dweller I know has at least had the conversation, with varying degrees of seriousness. Given the massive layoffs and surging unemployment rates, what with all those fundamental, root-chakra domains -- food, water, shelter -- now kneeling before the gods of chaos, the general consensus seems to be that it might just be an ideal time to take the burned-out husk of your 401K and get the hell out before the water riots begin.

But really, how do you know? After all, it's just terribly easy to get lost in the maelstrom, to have little or no idea exactly how bad it really is out there in Bedlamville, simply because the various sources that are supposed to tell us just how awful it is -- that is, this very major media -- are themselves undergoing such a massive upheaval that it's all they (that is, we) can do to stay upright and spell their own names correctly in the obituaries, much less accurately report on Japan's breakdown or just how terrifying Eastern Europe is right now and what, exactly, that might mean for the price of your 50-pound bag of Mexican avocados from Costco.

It's easy to give in and let The Fear swallow you whole. After all, if the bitchy president of the EU says President Obama's wildly audacious master plan is a ""road to hell,"" who are you to argue? If the experts say places like LA and Nevada are about to run out of water and start feeding on their young, what can you possibly do about it? If the punditry points out just how silly it is to be focusing on kittenish issues like the AIG scandal while ""the tiger sinks its teeth into the world's neck,"" well, who are you not to take heed?

"RFID technology is actually considered a hot topic in all scientific areas and has been described as a major enabling technology for the automation of many processes. Although it is not a new technology it has only recently come to the awareness of the public and is widely used in many sectors and particularly in healthcare. This paper aims to illustrate the utilisation of the RFID technology in healthcare, more precisely in infant security systems within the hospitals. To achieve this objective a case study about the experience of Portuguese hospitals in this system is presented and highlighted the main advantages reached with its utilisation."
" jazz and whatever else Björk could throw in the mix. The record was produced by Nellee Hooper, a DJ from the Bristol Wild Bunch collective who’d made a name for himself with his work on Soul II Soul’s Club Classics Vol I. Introduced to Hooper by her then-boyfriend, English DJ Dom T, Björk fell head over heels into a musical whirlwind affair celebrated on ‘Big Time Sensuality’: “Something important is about to happen/And we’re both included”. The Debut team – including Pop Group/PiL drummer Bruce Smith, Shamen vocalist Jhelisa Anderson and Talvin Singh, who played tabla and other percussion, as well as travelling to India to record a bona fide Bollywood string section for ‘Venus As A Boy' – would hit a different club every night after the sessions, and the record fizzes with the energy of discovery, Björk’s voice, so different from the usual style of dance vocalists, offering an entry point for those who wanted to join her mission of musical discovery: on ‘There’s More To Life Than This’, she runs off to the toilets of the Milk Bar nightclub to sing about nicking boats from the harbour, plotting to “rush down to the town’s best baker/To get the first bread of the morning”. The charm of the small-town girl on the rampage in the big city proved irresistible, and Debut sold 60,000 in the first month of its release, reaching No 3 in the UK chart, and earning Björk two Brit awards – Best International Female and Best International Breakthrough Act. This early success set her on a path she hadn’t expected, that of an accidental global pop star, forced to balance her art-punk origins and extreme tastes with reaching a huge new audience.

Telegram (1996)

Björk’s second mature solo album, Post, contains many of her best-known songs: 'Army Of Me', 'Hyperballad', 'It’s Oh So Quiet'. But its dark shadow self, Telegram, found Björk trying on wildly different guises, “not trying to make it pretty or peaceable for the ear,” as she told Mixmag, but “just like a record I would buy myself”. Debut had been followed by a 1994 remix EP, the catchily titled The Best Mixes From The Album Debut For All The People Who Don't Buy White Labels, with reworkings from Underworld, Sabres of Paradise and the Black Dog. Telegram, however, was promoted as an album in its own right, foregrounding Björk’s belief in remixing not just as a bonus to aid single sales, but as a way of reinventing her music, and of taking part in the sounds of those she admired without co-opting it. The tracklisting was wildly eclectic, from Dobie’s loping, hip hoppy take on ‘I Miss You’ or Dilinja’s skittering, nervy drum & bass rework of ‘Cover Me’ to a version of ‘Hyperballad’, the album’s lushest single, by avant garde classicists The Brodsky Quartet and ‘My Spine’, a Post offcut in collaboration with Scottish percussionist Evelyn Glennie. “I give it to the remixers and I just become a material to them. Like sugar or raisins,” she told Mixmag. “That is what’s challenging to me. To stop being the boss… Remixing allows me to always be me. It would not be honest for me to make a drum & bass record. It’s not where I come from… but I can go to a drum & bass person and say ‘Hello, my name is Björk and this is my voice and my song’ and they can make what they want from it. And you will see on the sleeve, ‘Björk remixed by Dilinja’. No one is stealing anyone else’s ideas and I don’t see it as ‘my work’ at all.”

All Björk’s singles continued to be released with a rich complement of remixes – Biophilia also has a sister remix record, Bastards. In 2005, she opened her work up to an even wider reinvention for the Army Of Me: Remixes And Covers charity album, raising money for those affected by the 2004 Asian tsunami. Putting a call out on her website, she chose from over 600 submissions from fans and musicians both amateur and professional. Biophilia went even further, allowing everyone who bought its apps to tinker"
"This paper describes some novel research results on bilateral teleoperation of a flexible catheter in a constrained environment. The dynamics of the catheter in a constrained environment is highly nonlinear and is affected by a large number of factors such as friction, flexibility of the catheter, force of insertion, shape and size of the catheter, etc. As a result, the distal end of the catheter almost never follows the actuated end of the catheter which could cause fatigue to the clinician/user attempting to insert the catheter in a blood vessel. In addition, there is a time delay of up to 0.8 second before the distal end of the catheter advances after the near end is actuated. This delay is sufficient to cause instability in the control loop. We have developed a teleoperation framework using wave variables to perform robot- assisted catheter insertion in a constrained environment while reflecting the forces at the tip of the catheter to the clinician. Experimental results showing the effect of different factors such as the velocity and stroke length of insertion on the delays introduced in control loop and errors between the master and slave position are included. To the best of our knowledge, this work is among the first to attempt to provide an understanding of the effects of various factors on the flexing of the catheter. In addition, master-slave insertion of a catheter instrumented with shape memory alloys (SMA) has also been performed and the results are included in this paper."
"Nodes in ad hoc networks generally transmit data at regular intervals over long periods of time. Recently, ad hoc network nodes have been built that run on little power and have very limited memory. In ad hoc networks authentication can be a significant challenge, even without considering size and power constraints. Assuming idealized hashing, this paper examines lower bounds for ad hoc broadcast authentication for /spl mu/-TESLA-like protocols. In particular this paper focuses on idealized hashing for generating preimages of hash chains. Using variations on these idealized hash functions, this paper gives an idealized time-space product /spl Omega/(t/sup 2/ log/sup 4/ n) bit operation/sup 1/ lower-bound for optimal preimage hash chain generation. Where n is the total length of the hash chain and the hash elements are t-wise independent. Given our foundations, these results follow as corollaries to a lower bound of Coppersmith and Jakobsson."
"Following Monday’s false dawn Britain, the EU and Ireland have finally reached a deal on Brexit, meaning talks can now move onto phase two.

Talks ran through the night between UK Prime Minister Theresa May, leader of the DUP – Northern Ireland’s biggest party – Arlene Foster, European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker and Irish leader Leo Varadkar.

Tensions between the leaders had reached fever pitch during the week as the heads of state fought their country’s corner. However, by Friday morning it was announced that marathon all-night talks had culminated in an initial plan on which everyone agreed.

Here RT breaks down the key points of that agreement:

Ireland gets to keep its soft border

We have achieved all we set out to achieve in Phase 1. This is not the end but it is the end of the beginning. The Good Friday Agreement is fully protected & the Common Travel Area will continue. The UK is committed to avoiding a hard border. #Brexitpic.twitter.com/kMxIMgBuAn — Leo Varadkar (@campaignforleo) December 8, 2017

The Irish government was unhappy with the language in the initial proposal from the UK on the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic.

Earlier in the week Taoiseach Varadkar (Ireland’s PM), even threatened to delay negotiations until the new year if a deal couldn’t be brokered.

Determined to move on to phase two of negotiations before the Christmas break, the group worked through the night to come up with a new agreement that Varadkar called “cast iron” and “bulletproof.”

All other issues are to be ironed out in phase two but, if those negotiations break down, there is now a clear default or insurance policy that guarantees there will be no customs or trade barriers between the Republic of Ireland and the UK.

Citizens get to keep their rights

1/2 Delighted we've reached an agreement which will give both Europeans here in the UK and British citizens in the EU binding guarantees about their residence rights. — Amber Rudd MP (@AmberRuddHR) December 8, 2017

As per the agreement, the more than 3 million EU citizens living and working in the UK will continue to enjoy the current freedom of movement principals. The guarantee also applies to British citizens living in other parts of the EU.

Crucially, everyone born in Northern Ireland will still retain EU AND British citizenship. The European Court of Justice will continue overseeing the rights of EU citizens in the UK for eight years after their withdrawal.

In his press conference Friday Varadkar told unionists in Northern Ireland: “We want to build bridges, not borders,” and to nationalists: “Your birthright as an Irish citizen is protected.""

Common travel area

Under Friday’s 11th hour deal citizens on the island of Ireland will continue to move freely between the North and Republic. This had been a major concern for business people, and the thousands who live and work either side of the border.

Going forward

Move to phase 2 of talks good - but devil is in the detail and things now get really tough. If #Brexit is happening (wish it wasn’t) staying in single market & customs union is only sensible option. And any special arrangements for NI must be available to other UK nations. — Nicola Sturgeon (@NicolaSturgeon) December 8, 2017

Talks will now turn to the transition period. The UK has asked for a two-year implementation period from the exit date, bringing the cut-off point to March 2021, in which they would remain in the Single Market and Customs Union – the terms of just how involved Britain will be in the EU during that period has yet to be determined.

Britain and the EU will also have to decipher what their relationship will look like post-divorce, specifically if and how the two will fight issues such terrorism and international crime together.

“We all know that breaking up is hard. But breaking up and building a new relation is much harder,” said President of the European Council Donald Tusk, harking back to Neil Sadaka’s 1975 hit.

“Since the Brexit referendum, a year and a half has passed. So much time has been devoted to the easier part of the task. And now, to negotiate a transition arrangement and the framework for our future relationship, we have de facto less than a year.”

"Existing version control approaches in database management systems (DBMSs) are still limited to providing version control functionality for the rollback to a previous state of the database itself and/or database schemas. The interrelations between changes to software artifacts produced during a database development process such as specifications, design diagrams, documentation, and database itself are not well managed by an DMBS. This paper presents an integrated approach that combines the structure-oriented software configuration management (SCM) and versioned hypermedia to control logical changes to software artifacts including entity-relationship diagrams (ERDs) and schema constructs, and to maintain consistent configurations among those constructs and versions of data. Logical connections among specifications and elements of an ERD are represented as hyperlinks and versioned as well."

Short answer: nuke the disclaimer notices

At which point, god help us all. Now, not only do we have fake sites putting out clickbait crap to game Facebook and Twitter, but now they’re not even clearly marked as fake news sites! Which means Google and Facebook will have to go back to step 1: identifying them based on the content.

So then we’re back to square one. But the problems don’t end with identifying fake news.

Oh no, there will be consequences when news sites inevitably get misflagged as ‘fake’. Such as say, a very angry webmaster/owner sending Google legal threats for cutting off their income based on what he sees as company bias/discrimination/whatever. Or complaining that Google’s actions (accusing his site of being fake) is considered libel or something.

It’s a legal minefield that could leave enough gaps in the terms and conditions to drive a (lawsuit )bus through.

And this is still only the tip of the iceberg when it comes to how awful this statement is and how badly these rules could be interpreted.

Because then we get to the whole ‘conceal information’ aspect. What counts as this?

Well, that’s a good question actually. Because the amount of things you could ban sites for based on the concept is insane.

For example, this could easily be used to shut off ads on sites run by anonymous or pseudonymous authors. After all, they could be seen as ‘concealing information about the publisher’, right?

I guess so.

Which means Google and co now have a nice way to shut down ads on any somewhat anonymous site that annoys them. Hence giving them a cruel way to blast many gaming site owners and political activists straight into the poorhouse.

Above: Sorry Sean Malstrom. Hope you don’t leave WordPress.com, otherwise Google will apparently cut off your advertising.

And it gets worse. Why? Because then ‘concealing information about the publisher’s content’ is even MORE vague.

I mean literally anything could be justified under that logic.

Used an anonymous source? You’re ‘concealing information about the content’ by protecting them and not providing their names. Like here:

Above image taken from a Lets Play Video Games article on the recent Rabbids/Mario RPG crossover rumours.

Say something you know is false because you’re under an embargo or agreement? That’s ‘concealing information about the content’.

Really, you could justify cutting off ads for a lot of reasons with this logic. Perhaps not always bad reasons (because hey, you could nail dishonest journalists for a ‘conflict of interest’ with the same ‘rule’), but enough that it should terrify the hell out of anyone doing journalism at all.

And that’s really the major issue. Google’s plans to stop fake news may be admirable, but the rules and ideas seem so vague that they can be used as a weapon against anyone for any reason whatsoever.

Add how they can just make the fake news problem worse (by incentivising people to lie about their site’s content), and you’ve got a ‘solution’ which could end up it being far worse than the actual problem.

But hey, maybe that’s the point. Maybe the idea isn’t really to stop fake news, but to hit anyone disagreeing with the mainstream narrative in the pocketbook, in hopes it’ll put ’em out of business. Perhaps Google just wants to play judge, jury and executioner.

Or maybe I’m too cynical. Either way, these rules don’t work, and need serious revision if Google thinks it can stop fake news with them."
"Toronto, ON – Earlier today The Board of Governors of the Ontario Hockey League approved the sale of the Sudbury Wolves Hockey Club from the Burgess and Edwards Family to Dario Zulich.

“The Burgess and Edwards Family have been the longest serving owners in the OHL having owned the storied Sudbury Wolves for 30 years. I want to thank them for their dedication to the interests and support of their players, the league and the fans in Sudbury,” said David Branch, OHL Commissioner. “The OHL welcomes Dario Zulich to the league and looks forward to celebrating the Wolves 45th anniversary in the 2016-2017 season.”

“I would like to thank everyone for their support over the past 30 years and I want to wish Dario all the best,” said Mark Burgess. “I look forward to concluding the sale in the days ahead.”

“I am grateful to the Board of Governors of the Ontario Hockey League for its approval of the ownership transfer of the Sudbury Wolves, enabling me to purchase the Wolves from the Burgess and Edwards families,” said Dario Zulich. “I am looking forward to the final step in the process, which will officially close the sale and purchase on a date to be determined prior to the start of the Wolves preseason.”

A media availability will be planned in Sudbury in the near future, and there will be no further comment until that time.
A group of renters discovered a badly decomposed body in the garden of their Airbnb rental in suburban Paris over the weekend. The body of the woman was covered with tree branches.

""Her body was found at the bottom of the property which opens out into woods,"" a police source said, according to France 24. Authorities are now investigating the death in Palaiseau, in the southern suburbs of Paris. Foul play is suspected.

The people renting the house were only there for a weekend, although they are being questioned.

The cause of death has not yet been determined, according to police. The woman's body was found ""hunched in a dug-out area, her head against the ground, covered in branches and surrounded by wood stumps,"" France 24 reported. There will be an autopsy.

The listing was removed from Airbnb on Sunday, according to Le Parisien.

""We have offered our assistance to the police and will help them with their investigation in any way we can,"" an Airbnb spokesperson told Mashable. ""In addition, we reached out to the host and guests and will provide all necessary support.""

""Over 80 million people have travelled on Airbnb and problems for hosts and guests are extremely rare.""

President Trump has been informed of Justice Anthony Kennedy’s impending resignation, meaning that the president will soon make his second pick for the Supreme Court, according to White House sources speaking with Trump insider Roger Stone.

This development, exclusive to Infowars, is the first confirmation of the 80-year-old’s retirement, which the mainstream media has speculated for the past hour.

U.S. Circuit Judge Thomas Hardiman, who was on Trump’s short list when he selected Neil Gorsuch for the vacancy left by the late Antonin Scalia, is said to be the front-runner for the opening seat.

That said, the president will consider other candidates as well – including perhaps Judge Andrew Napolitano, a surprise candidate who’s long been a favorite of Trump’s.

Kennedy, a Reagan appointee described as a conservative centrist, holds a controlling vote on the court and has often decided cases by his one vote.

Trump indicated this weekend that he heard rumors about Kennedy’s retirement.

“I’ve heard the same rumors that a lot of people have heard,” the president told media. “And I have a lot of respect for that gentleman, a lot.”

Gorsuch was confirmed by the Senate on April 7 after a lengthy confirmation battle.
